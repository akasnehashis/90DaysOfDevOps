    Devops is a culture where Developmentr team and OPerations team works together to continously develop, deploy and maintain the application ans aslo helps to minimize downtime and developmnet/release time significantly.

    Automation: Automation is nothing but the process of doing repetative manual work automatically.
    Scaling: Scaling is a technnology which is used to increase or decrese the number of resouce. For example when work pressue is high, need more resources and when work is low need less resouces, This process of managing resources based on the work is called Scaling.
    Infrastructure: Infrastructure is basically piller or foundation on which all the works will be done.

 - Why DevOps is Important, etc
    Devops is important because in Normal process the time to release and development is high and to reduce that gap betwwen developer and Operations team need Devops person. In the normal method application is release in 1 or 3 months or so, if new feature needs to be added post build creation then that cannot be done, so takle that Devops will enable continious development and continious deployment and monitoring by automating the process.
